# Lovelace Animated Weather Card for NWS Entities

Forked from [bramkragten](https://github.com/bramkragten/weather-card) and updated to work with the [National Weather Service (NWS)](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nws/) integration.  ```hourly_forecast: false``` is required for daily forecast to work correctly.  If using daily forecast the card parses the forecast HA sensor arrry for ```daytime: true``` and adds the low overnight temperatures based on ```daytime: false```.  

History:

Originally created for the [old UI](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-ui-weather-state-card-with-a-question/23008) converted by @arsaboo and @ciotlosm to [Lovelace](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-ui-weather-state-card-with-a-question/23008/291) and now converted to Lit to make it even better.

This card uses the awesome [animated SVG weather icons by amCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/free-animated-svg-weather-icons/).
